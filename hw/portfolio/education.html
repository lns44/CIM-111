<p> I started studying at Singapore American School in 2014, and graduated High School there in 2016. Moving to Singapore did not only provide the oporunity for me to travel around Asia with my family, but also for sports. Attending Singapore American school allows selected varsity students to compete in a mid-season and final tournament that takes place at one of our ‘IASAS’ school every season. IASAS stands for Interscholastic Association of Southeast Asia Schools. The schools we compete against include Jakarta International School, International School of Kuala Lumpur, Tapei International School, International School of Manila and International School of Bangkok. During my two years at SAS, I played soccer and basketball competitively.  </p>
