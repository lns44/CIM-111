<p> “Lauren became a valued teammate at Adworks as our intern over the months of May, June and July 2018. What impressed us at Adworks was her ability to meet deadlines and create ideas and opportunities for each task she was given. Beyond her abilities as a marketer/ communicator, her thoughtful personality, knowledge and skills left a mark in this company that will raise the bar for future interns. I would like to reiterate my support for Lauren on future projects and strongly recommend her to any company. Her drive and positive attitude will, without hesitation, make here a contender in her future as a top exectutive."

<p> “I am proud to recommend Lauren as a candidate for an internship this summer. Lauren is smart and very dedicated- she received top marks in most of the assignments and put in the effort to fix and revise the ones she had trouble with. She has also shown great leadership skills in assigned team projects. Last but not least, Lauren is very professional- she is mature and has excellent poise.” <br> <br>
