    <pstyle="text-align:left;">  Growing up in England, soccer (football) was a big part of my culture. Starting at the age of three, soccer was my favorite sport. The way I feel when I'm participating in sports, especially during a game, is unlike any other feeling I've ever experienced. As I got older, soccer became an outlet to make some of my best friends, push myself both psychically and mental, as well as sometimes be a stress relief (and other times a stress inducer). Focusing on something other than the stresses in life from things such as school or friends, sports was a constant relief where none of that mattered. All that mattered was doing my best, and hopefully winning the game in front of me. Growing up in Europe allowed me to go to several premier league games and indulge in the sports culture.

    Born in Minnesota, my family moved to England before I turned one. I lived there and went to a British school and an International school for the sixteen years I lived there. Living in England, I was fortunate enough to travel extensively across Europe for my sports, family trips as well as school trips. After my brother graduated from high school, we decided to move to Singapore while my brother went to college. As a high school junior, I moved to Singapore having never been to visit previously even the continent. With such a different culture and lifestyle, some of my life's best moments are thanks to traveling in Asia. Having traveled to almost 20 counties in the two years I lived in Singapore, I learned many new things about me and the world we live in. Each and every one of us is unique and that what makes so beautiful. We each can learn something from each other. I believe that travel is a great way to become exposed to other walks of lives to be more aware of what's going on across the whole world. It is easy to get caught up in our own lives and country and fail to forget the bigger picture. There is a whole world out there. It's waiting to be explored!  I have seen and learned a lot of things during my time there which is why I decided to make a website documenting and highlighting some of my monumental experiences. </p>

    <pstyle="text-align:left;"> While growing up in England, I attended two different schools. The first school I attended was an all girls catholic British school called Notre Dame. After 6th grade, I switched schools to ACS Cobham International School so I could prepare adjust to the american school system which included AP courses in high school. At ACS I made friends from all over the globe. I learnt a lot about my friends different cultures and lifestyles. I also had the opportunity to travel to numerous European countries through school trips, family trips as well as sporting trips. In middle school and high school I took Spanish classes. One of my most memorable trips was when everyone who was taking Spanish as their foregone language had the opportunity to visit Spain for a week to me immersed in the culture as well as practice what we had been learning in the classroom by talking to locals.  </p>

        <pstyle="text-align:left;">  Moving to Singapore did not only provide the oporunity for me to travel around Asia with my family, but also for sports. Attending Singapore American school allows selected varsity students to compete in a mid-season and final tournament that takes place at one of our ‘IASAS’ school every season. IASAS stands for Interscholastic Association of Southeast Asia Schools. The schools we compete against include JIS (Jakarta International School), ISKL (International School of Kuala Lumpur, TAS (Tapei International School), ISM (International School of Manila) and ISB (International School of Bangkok). During my two years in high school at SAS, I had the opportunity to compete in ISKL, ISM, JIS and HKIS (Hong Kong International School) for a special thanksgiving holiday tournament.During my two years at SAS, I played soccer and basketball competitively. </p>

<pstyle="text-align:left;"> Going into my junior year in high school, I moved schools from ACS to SAS. At first, moving to Asia after having never been before was quiet a culture shock, but over time I adjusted and loved my time there. At SAS I had the opportunity to take AP’s to help transition post graduation into an american university. While I attended SAS I was lucky enough to travel to 20 different countries through sports, school trips and family travel.
One of my greatest travel experiences I made in Asia was through the SAS school program, ‘Interim.’ For one week during second semester, all regularly scheduled high school courses stop while students and teachers participate in a global program. Interim is a required off-campus experience designed to improve the curriculum by providing high school students with unique educational experiences beyond the classroom. </p>
