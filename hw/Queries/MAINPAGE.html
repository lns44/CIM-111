<p style= "margin-left:230px;"> Hi, I’m Lauren! Born in Minnesota, my family moved to England before I turned one. I lived there and went to a British school and an International school for the sixteen years I lived there. Living in England, I was fortunate enough to travel extensively across Europe for my sports, family trips as well as school trips. After my brother graduated from high school, we decided to move to Singapore while my brother went to college. As a high school junior, I moved to Singapore having never been to visit previously even the continent. With such a different culture and lifestyle, some of my life's best moments are thanks to traveling in Asia. Having traveled to almost 20 counties in the two years I lived in Singapore, I learned many new things about me and the world we live in. Each and every one of us is unique and that what makes so beautiful. We each can learn something from each other. I believe that travel is a great way to become exposed to other walks of lives to be more aware of what's going on across the whole world. It is easy to get caught up in our own lives and country and fail to forget the bigger picture. There is a whole world out there. It's waiting to be explored!  I have seen and learned a lot of things during my time there which is why I decided to make a website documenting and highlighting some of my monumental experiences.</p>
